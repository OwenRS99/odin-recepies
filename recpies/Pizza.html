    <h3><strong>How to make</strong></h3>
    <h4>Ingredients: </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>300g strong bread flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp instant yeast (from a sachet or a tub)</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li> 
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.</li>
        <li>Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</li>
    </ol>
